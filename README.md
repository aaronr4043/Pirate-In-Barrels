Pirates in a Barrel is a Pirate themed tower defense game origionally created for the 2016 Games Fleadh and was later demoed at the 2016 Project Fair.
As a team of three we created the game using Unity 5. 
This is the third repository for the project as the other two have been corrupted. They can be found here https://github.com/aaronr4043/Pirates-In-A-Barrel and here https://github.com/aaronr4043/Pirates-In-Barrels
